## Short Description
**CrowdCube** is a crowdfunding platform that allows individuals to raise funds for personal, creative, or entrepreneurial projects. Whether itâ€™s for medical expenses, launching a new startup, or funding creative ideas, CrowdCube connects users with potential supporters. Built using React, Firebase, Tailwind, MongoDB, and Node Express, it offers a seamless, secure platform for raising money and building communities.


## Problem I Have Faced
During the development of **CrowdCube**, I faced multiple challenges, including issues with Firebase authentication, connecting the server to the client-side and database, and solving CORS middleware problems. Additionally, I struggled with deploying the project, as this was my first experience using MongoDB and Node Express.

Despite these obstacles, I successfully overcame them and completed the project, gaining valuable experience. Alhamdulillah.
